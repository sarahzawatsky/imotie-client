imotie

imotie is an emotional regulation app that helps children to identify, track, and understand their emotion.  After spending four years teaching in an incredibly diverse middle school, I worked with dozens of students who faced steep socioemotional learning challenges. For many children, academic learning cannot occur until socioemotional needs are met. Emotional intelligence, emotional literacy, and mindfulness are major factors that set students up for success and and build self-efficacy later in life.  While all children can benefit from social-emotional learning techniques, imotie is specially geared toward autistic children and children with emotional regulation challenges.
